        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Matoke </li>
            <li>Oil </li>
            <li>Medium onion – diced</li>
            <li>Lamb or beef – cut into small cubes. </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon grated ginger</li>
            <li>1½ lb beef cut into small cubes. </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon chicken bouillon powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>4 medium tomatoes diced</li>
            <li>2½ to 3 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>A handful of chopped coriander leaves or cilantro</li>
        

        </ul>
        <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
        <p>Peel and cut the matoke into 1.5 – 2 inch pieces. Put them in water till you are ready to use them so that they don’t become discolored.</p>
        <p>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat, add onions, and cook until soft, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>Stir in the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant—a few seconds.</p>
        <p>Stir in the beef and add the paprika, curry powder, bouillon powder, salt, and pepper. Mix well, cover, and leave to cook for 10 minutes, stirring halfway between.
        </p>
        <p>Add the matoke, diced tomatoes, and stock (or water), stir, cover, and leave to simmer for 25 to 30 minutes or till the matoke becomes tender.</p>
        <p>Stir in the coriander and serve.</p>
        <p><em>ENJOY!</em></p>
